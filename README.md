# Data-Mining-IUT
This repository contains my codes and answers to the Data Mining course homework which I passed in Isfahan University of Technology. In this course we learned about Data science methodology which is shown below. We worked with several datasets for more comprehention as well.

### Homework 1
This Homework focused on preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Question 2: Student's dataset analysis and exploration
- Question 3: Working with Machines dataset and exploring it
- Question 4: Checking whether the Machines dataset is balanced or imbalanced
- Question 5: Finding outliers and removing them in Machines Dataset
- Question 6: Binning CACH column in the Dataset
- Question 7:Exploring Kaggle Titanic Dataset

### Homework 2
The aim of this homework is again EDA and setup phase
- Question 1: Exploratory data Analysis for credit card dataset
- Question 2: Exploratory data Analysis for Heart Disease dataset
- Question 3: Overlay charts
- Question 4: Binning based on predictive variable
- Question 5: Whole methodology on titanic dataset
